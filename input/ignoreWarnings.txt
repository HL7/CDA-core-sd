# We need this version of hl7.terminology
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.terminology.r5#5.2.0 released on 2023-07-17, but the most recent appropriate version is 7.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# This extension is used in the base FHIR spec
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'
